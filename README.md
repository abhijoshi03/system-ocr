## Introduction

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. The **System OCR** project provides an easy-to-use API that leverages system capabilities to perform OCR tasks efficiently.

## Features

- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate into existing applications.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to ensure text recognition is accurate.
- **Multi-format Support**: Works with various image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and TIFF.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal system requirements for installation.
- **Customizable**: Options to tweak settings for specific use cases.

## Installation

To get started with **System OCR**, you need to download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/abhijoshi03/system-ocr/releases). 

1. Go to the [Releases section](https://github.com/abhijoshi03/system-ocr/releases).
2. Download the latest release suitable for your operating system.
3. Extract the files to your desired location.
4. Follow the instructions in the README file included in the release.

## Usage

Once you have installed the **System OCR**, you can start using the API. 

### Basic Workflow

1. **Input Image**: Provide an image containing the text you want to extract.
2. **API Call**: Send a request to the OCR API with the image.
3. **Receive Output**: The API will return the extracted text in a readable format.

### Example Request

Here’s a simple example of how to make a request to the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ocr \
  -F "image=@path/to/your/image.jpg"
```

### Example Response

The API will return a JSON response like this:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "text": "This is the extracted text from the image."
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

The **System OCR** API provides the following endpoints:

### 1. `/ocr`

- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Accepts an image file and returns the extracted text.
- **Parameters**:
  - `image`: The image file to process.

### 2. `/health`

- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Checks the status of the OCR service.
- **Response**:
  - `status`: Indicates if the service is running.

## Examples

Here are some practical examples of how to use the **System OCR** API in different programming languages.

### Python Example

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:5000/ocr"
files = {'image': open('path/to/your/image.jpg', 'rb')}
response = requests.post(url, files=files)

print(response.json())
```

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');
const fs = require('fs');

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('image', fs.createReadStream('path/to/your/image.jpg'));

axios.post('http://localhost:5000/ocr', formData, {
    headers: formData.getHeaders()
})
.then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
});
```
